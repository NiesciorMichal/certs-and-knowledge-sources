# Kaggle Community

I would like to present you the greatest ML/ DL/ AI Community.
If you haven't heard about them, there are tons of:
- **Datasets**
- **Notebooks** (Jupyter)
- Free learning **Courses with Certifications** each lesson has its own **Jupyter with Exercises**
- **Competitions** where you can evaluate the accuracy of your model
- Discussions, FAQs etc.
